<p>The project was made using RaspberryPi 3. The task was to provide the user with information about the temperature of household appliances, fire hazard and door closing. </p>
Used to complete the project:</br>
Hardwear
<ul> 
  <li>RaspberryPi v3</li>
  <li>LM35DZ NS temperature sensor - analog THT</li>
  <li>DS18B20 Temperature Sensor with</li>
  <li>USB webcam</li>
  <li>reed switch</li>
  <li>Apache Server for local tests</li>
</ul>

Softwear
<ul> 
  <li>Python v3</li>
  <li>OpenCv</li>

<p>
  Locally running server managed running scripts that analyzed the status of household appliances. <br>
  User was notified that he was leaving the apartment when, for example, the stove was working.<br>
  It was possible to preview the temperature of the devices in the prepared panel. <br>
  Based on the camera view, a script based on the OpenCv library was prepared to analyze the presence of fire.
